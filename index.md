## The meaning of this blog

This is a personal blog to share emotions and experiences, even though there are a lot of words to say, I still do not know where to start. It is kind of weird to start recording daily life at this time period. But life is so mysterious that a single choice can totally change the trajectory. The accumulation of very single effort can truly change the world.

## About me

I am an ordinary person, not a genius but choose to study for a PhD degree. The research area is not so attractive to me but it is kind of interesting. The work I am doing now is also different from my initial intention or the dream in my childhood. I really hope my children would not follow my route again and do whatever they want.
